# Requirements
[ ] Display the current time in a digital clock format

[ ] Display in this format: (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) (counting up to something within the same day) and (Day-Month-Year) if applicable (counting up to something on a different day)

[ ] Pick a time to make the alarm go off (this can be done as a variable)

[ ] Make sure the clock updates every second without refreshing the page

[ ] Start the alarm when the difference between the current time and the time the alarm is set for reaches 0 (Tip: use a javascript alert, you do not need it to make noise)
